## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? -- I want to become a software engineer and learn how to use different programming languages.
- Why did you build this project? -- This seemed like a great way to review the basics of front-end development and become more familiar with programming languages.
- What problem does it solve? -- The study guide helps me to list notes about different programming languages/areas of software development.
- What did you learn? -- I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned a lot about navigating git/GitHub.

## Usage

The study guide is divided into four main sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains useful information about each topic.

Also, if we open the DevTools console, we can see JavaScript running code to suggest what we should study.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
